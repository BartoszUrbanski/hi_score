# hi\_score by Michael S. Mikowski
This is the set of libraries I use for SPA development.

## Overview
There it is again. The new *hot* SPA framework that makes our current
one obsolete.  Now we have to unlearn everything from the old and reinvest
in the new *hotness*.  Some developers have spent far more time learning
framework DSLs than pure JavaScript. Are we ready to get off that
treadmill?

What we have to ask is [do we really want an SPA framework?][0]  If not,
then **hi**\_**score** is here to help.  Our intention is to provide 
an ever improving set of best-in-class libraries that we control, instead of
having a framework that controls us.

## Code Style
The library we have authored are written in the code style presented in 
the book book **Single Page Web Applications - JavaScript end-to-end**
which is available from [Amazon][1] and directly from [Manning][2].
All of them pass JSLint. All object keys have an underscore prefix and
suffix like `_this_` which makes them easy targets for compression.

## The Goal
Provide an architecture guide, starter files, and best-in-class libraries
recommended for SPA development.  This environment will progress as
technology and support evolve.

## Compatibility
Our baseline compatibility is IE9+.
